Sharing
=========================================

Introduction
------------

Socialize provides a complete set of helper functions to make sharing content
in your app as easy as possible.

UI Elements
-------------------------

Share Dialog
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The simplest way to allow users to share an entity (your content) is via the
share dialog.  Note that if you need to set meta information on the entity, you
must do so with a separate call to [SZEntityUtils addEntity:success:failure:]

.. literalinclude:: snippets/sharing.m
	:start-after: begin-show-share-dialog-snippet
	:end-before: end-show-share-dialog-snippet

.. image:: images/share_dialog.png

.. _custom_share_dialog:

Custom Share Dialog Behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you'd like, you can override some of Socialize's share functionality

.. literalinclude:: snippets/sharing.m
	:start-after: begin-show-share-dialog-with-options-snippet
	:end-before: end-show-share-dialog-with-options-snippet

Refer to :ref:`custom_wall_post` and :ref:`show_sms` for more details on customizing Facebook and SMS functionality

Manually instantiating the share dialog controller
~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you need to, you can directly instantiate the share dialog and manage its lifecycle on your own.

.. literalinclude:: snippets/sharing.m
	:start-after: begin-manual-show-share-dialog-snippet
	:end-before: end-manual-show-share-dialog-snippet

Working with Shares
-------------------

Programmatic Sharing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Should you need to create a share programatically, you can do so. If you specify nil for
the share options, the default share options from the user profile will be used.

.. literalinclude:: snippets/sharing.m
	:start-after: begin-create-share-snippet
	:end-before: end-create-share-snippet

.. _custom_wall_post:

Customizing the Content of Facebook Posts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Before your share is sent off to Facebook, you are given an opportunity to modify
the parameters used to post to the user's wall

.. literalinclude:: snippets/sharing.m
	:start-after: begin-customize-facebook-share-snippet
	:end-before: end-customize-facebook-share-snippet

.. _show_sms:

Directly Opening an SMS or Email Composer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you'd like to skip the share dialog and just present an email or SMS share dialog, you
can do so

.. literalinclude:: snippets/sharing.m
	:start-after: begin-show-sms-snippet
	:end-before: end-show-sms-snippet

.. literalinclude:: snippets/sharing.m
	:start-after: begin-show-email-snippet
	:end-before: end-show-email-snippet

You can retrieve information about what has been shared in your application.

.. literalinclude:: snippets/sharing.m
	:start-after: begin-get-shares-snippet
	:end-before: end-get-shares-snippet

List all shares in the application
	
.. literalinclude:: snippets/shares.m
  :start-after: begin-list-by-application-snippet
  :end-before: end-list-by-application-snippet
