This is a general facade of the   SDK`s API. Through it a third party developers could use the API.
 
@warning *Note:* Every thing in socialize revolves around the concept of "Entity". An entity could be liked, unliked, commented on etc. 
In Socialize an entity can only be a url. So when creating an entity always remember to input the key for the entity as a url 
otherwise you will get a failure.
