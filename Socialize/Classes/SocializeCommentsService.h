 Parameters first and last (OPTIONAL) : specify range to do pagination by entityâ€™s key. First is included, and last is excluded.
 
 Default values:
 first = 0
 last = 100
 
 @warning *Note:*
 Each request is limited to 100 items.
 If first = 0, last = 50, the API returns comments 0-49.
 If last - first > 100, then last is truncated to equal first + 100. For example, if first = 100, last = 250, then last is changed to last = 200.
 If only last = 150 is passed, then last is truncated to 100. If last = 25, then results 0...24 are returned.
 
 @param entryKey URL to the entity.
 @param first First comment. Could be nil. (OPTIONAL)
 @param last Last comment. Could be nil. (OPTIONAL)
