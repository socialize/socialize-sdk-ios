Socialize Entities
==================

An *Entity* is the term Socialize uses to describe any item of content within
your app. This could be anything from a News Article to a Hamburger and simply
provides a reference point from which your users can perform social actions
such as liking, commenting and sharing.

For example, imagine your app is a photography app where users can share photos
they take with their device. In this scenario each photo would be an *entity*
and users can then perform social actions on this entity.

.. note:: It is recommended that where possible an HTTP URL be used for your entity key

Entities in Socialize MUST be associated with a unique key. It is recommended
that where possible an HTTP URL be used (i.e. one that corresponds to an active
web page that your entity will represent). If your entities do not have web addressable URLs, Socialize can
automatically generate an Entity Page for you. Refer to the
:ref:`entity_no_url` section on this page for more information.

Auto-Creation of Entities
-------------------------

In most cases Socialize will automatically create an entity for you based on
the information you provide to a particular call in the SDK.

For example, if you are using the :doc:`action_bar` the entity that you pass to
the Action Bar will be automatically created for you if it does not already
exist.

.. note:: You should always specify a name when creating an entity, however if you have previously created the entity with a name and do not want to specify the name every time you can provide a "null" argument for the name. This will instruct Socialize to ignore the name attribute and the name of the entity will NOT be updated.

Working with Entities
-------------------------

Creating an Entity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note:: You do necessarily need to create an entity on your own. The `Comment <comments.html#working-with-comments>`_, `Like <likes.html#working-with-likes>`_, and `Share <sharing.html#working-with-shares>`_ utility functions will automatically create any specified entities.

.. literalinclude:: snippets/entities.m
	:start-after: begin-create-snippet
	:end-before: end-create-snippet


Retrieving Entity Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An existing entity can be retrieved via the getEntity method. Entities obtained
in this way will also provide aggregate data on comments, likes, shares and
views. Refer to the `Entity Object Structure <http://api.getsocialize.com/docs/v1/#entity-object>`_  in the API Docs. for more detail on
these aggregate values.

.. literalinclude:: snippets/entities.m
	:start-after: begin-get-snippet
	:end-before: end-get-snippet

You can also retrieve several entities in one call:

.. literalinclude:: snippets/entities.m
	:start-after: begin-get-many-snippet
	:end-before: end-get-many-snippet

Or page through entities for the entire application

.. literalinclude:: snippets/entities.m
	:start-after: begin-get-all-snippet
	:end-before: end-get-all-snippet

You can select a sort order for listed entities

.. literalinclude:: snippets/entities.m
	:start-after: begin-get-popular-snippet
	:end-before: end-get-popular-snippet

Entity Stats
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each entity object retrieved from the server contains aggregate statistics
about the number of comments,likes,views and shares:

.. literalinclude:: snippets/entities.m
	:start-after: begin-print-stats-snippet
	:end-before: end-print-stats-snippet

Entity Metadata
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Entities stored in Socialize can optionally include meta data. This is for any
additional information you want to store about the entity.

Meta data is stored with the entity and returned then the entity is requested.

.. literalinclude:: snippets/entities.m
	:start-after: begin-basic-meta-snippet
	:end-before: end-basic-meta-snippet

If you want a more complex data structure, we recommend using JSON as an object
notation. To do this, you will need to use a third party library such as the
excellent `JSONKit <https://github.com/johnezang/JSONKit/>`_

.. literalinclude:: snippets/entities.m
	:start-after: begin-json-meta-snippet
	:end-before: end-json-meta-snippet

Entity Activity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For information on retrieving a social activity stream for a given entity, see the `Actions Section <actions.html#working-with-actions>`_.

.. _entity_no_url:

Entities Without URLs
---------------------

.. _SmartDownload: http://go.getsocialize.com/SmartDownloads

All entities in Socialize will be given an automatically generated entity page which forms part of the Socialize SmartDownload_ process.

This default entity page can be **completely customized** to suit the look and feel of your app as well as being able to display specific information
taken from your entity meta data.

.. note:: If your entity key uses an HTTP URL the contents of your entity page will be automatically parsed from that URL by default

To customize the content displayed on your entity pages simply add a JSON structure to your entity **meta data** that includes the following *szsd_* prefixed attributes:

.. literalinclude:: snippets/entity_page_json.txt
   :language: javascript
   :tab-width: 4
   
In code this would look something like this

.. literalinclude:: snippets/entities.m
  :start-after: begin-custom-entity-page-snippet
  :end-before: end-custom-entity-page-snippet
  
This will display on your entity page like this:

.. image:: images/szsd_entity_page.png

.. include:: footer.inc
